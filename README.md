# Flood Map Pattern Library

![floodmap-library](https://github.com/andruwcruz/floodmap-library/blob/master/floodmap-cover.png)

This repo is the pattern library of a web app I worked on.

I plan on using this template for future pattern libraries my clients may ask for but feel free to use these files.

Built from good ole html & css here.
